A great way to keep up with some rails tips and ideas. I have started watching rails casts when I am eating a snack, working out, or just have a few minutes. It is a great and simple way to keep rails ideas fresh in your head. Most of the tips are fairly basic for now, but I am hoping they start dipping into more complex rails solutions. Or how to break out of the framework when it makes sense.    [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/)
