Today I accomplished alot on many different programming projects. 3 to be correct. Anyways, I got my comp org program almost done which is nice. I made some really good progress on my text categorization project for work. Then finally for my 3d graphics class i made some good progress on my very simple 3d shooter.


I am happy to have accomplished so much, but on the downside it is 10:30 and i have been programming the entire day on one project or another. Argg...


I swear i will have to do something fun and exciting for all of you soon. Then i will have something worth writting about again, but until then here is a picture of my 3d shooter in progress
