This is a collection of various tips and things I use in MySQL. This is actually up on the web more as a reference to myself than anything else. I keep learning this stuff, but since I don't use it all that frequently I tend to forget how to do something exactly the next time i need to. So here are little commands I use and some tiny descriptions. If you have some tips tricks or think i am doing something the hard way please feel free to comment and share. If you have any MySQL questions please feel free to post them if you think it is something I might be able to help you with. That said here is mysql information...

 //creates a new table in the database your currently using
`create table "tablename" ("column1" "data type", "column2" "data type", "column3" "data type");`

 //creates a link table (which is really the same as other tables but just//a way to associate data between tablescreate table link (catID bigint, pageID bigint);

 //deletes an entire tabledrop table Pages;

//to recreate the database from the dump file
`./mysql -u root -pPASSWORD newsshaker < ./newsshakerdb.txt//at the command line in the mysql/bin directory`


//to get the count in a category since a date:
`select count(*) as co from Pages as p left join link as l on p.UID = l.PageID left join categories as c on c.UID = l.CatID where c.name like 'autism' and p.date > 20031201000000 group by c.UID;`


//to get only 5 in order as the very newest:
`select p.UID,p.date,c.UID from Pages as p left join link as l on p.UID = l.PageID left join categories as c on c.UID = l.CatID where c.name like 'autism' and p.date > 20031201000000 order by p.date DESC limit 5;`

//to get a whole category:
`select p.UID,p.date,c.UID from Pages as p left join link as l on p.UID = l.PageID left join categories as c on c.UID = l.CatID where c.name like 'autism';`

//add a new user to your mysql system
`mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'monty'@'localhost'    ->     IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass' WITH GRANT OPTION;`

//getting random results from a mysql query or mysql table
`mysql_query("SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1")`
