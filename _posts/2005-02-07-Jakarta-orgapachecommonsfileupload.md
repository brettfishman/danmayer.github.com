Using this package caused a little more problems than one would have believed, but it was by far still the best option out there. I found some other beens, but they only would successfully upload Ascii files and were not writen properly to write out image files or other binary data. After having a problem with a few other packages I went to use Jakarta's java fileupload and after figuring out multiple issues and reading alot of documentation I got all of it working as I wanted. I thought I should share th links I ended up using that were usefull and helped me get everything working.

[File upload wrapper](http://www.theserverside.com/articles/article.tss?l=HttpClient_FileUpload) take a look at ProcessFileUpload.jsp
