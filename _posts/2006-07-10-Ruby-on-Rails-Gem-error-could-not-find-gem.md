I got this gem error on Ubuntu 6.06 over and over then finally I followed these instructions to install Ruby on Rails,    [Install Ruby on Rails on Ubuntu 6.06](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RubyOnRails)    and I changed one line:    sudo gem update --system IS WRONG!!!!    run:    sudo gem update    and thing all the sudo gem installs work perfectly fine for me. Why I have no idea. I hate computers sometimes, but at least ruby and rails now work for Ubuntu 6.06 on my system.
