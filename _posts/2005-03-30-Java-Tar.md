Java Tar source. This might not be the final draft, but it is getting pretty close. Most features seem to be working well and the source is very well documentated. So if you want or need the new GNU features you can get them from java tar here. The main java tar build hasnt incoporated these yet but all of the modifications have been sent off to them, so hopefully they will incorporate them soon.    [Java Tar homepage](http://www.trustice.com/java/tar/)    Until then feel free to download the java tar source from me. You can edit and modify as much as the orginal liscense allows, which says it is public domain use it as you wish. I would like to give a big thanks to Timothy Gerard Endres, who is the orginal author of Java Tar.  If you have any questions comments or problems let me know.
