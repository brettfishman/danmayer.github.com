Again I am truly sorry that i haven't been posting anything here. School, My job hunt, and other things have b een taking my time. I have written quite a bit of code and hopefully will post it all soon. I have alot of little pocket pc applications and I also have done decision trees, neural networks, and probabilistic agents.    I might have a pretty cool final project for my AI course to post but that will really depend on what I have time to end up doing for a project.
