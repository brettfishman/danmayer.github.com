Here is a list of some good start up resources that I have begun to check out on the web.    [Paul Graham's essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)<br />[Clay Shirky's essays](http://shirky.com/)<br />[OnStartups](http://onstartups.com/)<br />[Small Business Hub](http://www.smallbusinesshub.com/)<br />[Startup news](http://news.ycombinator.com/)<br />[programming.reddit.com](http://programming.reddit.com/)<br />[Good start up books to read](http://blog.pretheory.com/arch/000362.php)<br />    Hopefully I will grow this list a bit more shortly, but for now that is some good information to get your started.
