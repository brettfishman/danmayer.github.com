I know I don't actually post to this blog much at all, but I still occasionally add some stuff on it and I might slowly be bringing it back to life. So with that in mind I thought I should announce that I am now the co founder of a start up. [Pretheory](http://www.pretheory.com). If you want to keep up with the various projects we are working on the best place to check is over at the [Pretheory blog](http://blog.pretheory.com).     Currently we are programming in Ruby on Rails, and we are hoping to have our first project launched by early August. So if you have been following this blog at all, keep and eye on [Pretheory](http://www.pretheory.com) now as well.     [{% unless page.image %}
