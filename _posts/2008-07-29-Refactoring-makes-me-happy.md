I still get such a kick out of refactoring and shrinking down code. I try not to shrink it to the point that it is harder to read. I think some people get a little overzealous with refactoring and obscure so much of the code that it is no longer that readable, or everything is 20 levels deeper than it should be when you are in a debugger trying to trace a programs execution.    Anyways I was cleaning up a bunch of little TODOs or ugly sections of code that had been building up in some of our files. It felt good, and should make things even simpler moving forward.
