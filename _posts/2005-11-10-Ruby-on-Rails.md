I have been learning the language ruby, and have begun playing around with ruby on rails. Which is a development framework for web based applications. I have been really impressed with ruby on rails so far, I was worried about how extendable it would be to less general problems, but it seems to be fairly extendable. Which is cool. I highly recommend giving it a shot and I think this was the best tutorial I have gone through while learning ruby.    [Ruby on rails tutorial, building a cookbook](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/20/rails.html?page=1)    I also recommend [Agile web development with Rails, from the Pragmatic Programmers](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html)
