Well first sorry about the site being down for awhile, my hosting service had some problems, but they have it fixed.    Second, i finished my openGL project for fractal terrains today. This project took me entirely way to long, but it has been hard to move back to c++ after having all the nice things java provides you for so long. Anyways i am slowly getting back on track. So take a look and i hope you all like my little fractals. It is alot cooler if you actually have the program since you can rotate and do all sorts of stuff with the terrain then. Oh well back to laying and now moving.    {% unless page.image %}
