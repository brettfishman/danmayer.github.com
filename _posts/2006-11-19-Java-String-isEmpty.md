I have heard the java string class will finally get the isEmpty method in an upcoming release. Lets hope it is in 1.6, because I can't wait much longer, I can't for the life of me see why this was ignored for so long. Why have I had to put this in so many freakin if statements when this could have been fixed by adding a very easy and simple but amazingly easy to read and useful method.    String randWord;    /*random code or back in forth between many different classes */    String someFunction() {if(randWord!=null && !randWord.equals("")) {  /*do something*/}    ....}    all of this could just be replaced and make the code so much more readable with the isEmpty function, becoming the following...    if( !randWord.isEmpty() ) {  /*do something*/}    I want this functionality and I want it now... I guess since java is now opensource I should just go override the String class to add one simple function! So much value and so simple.
