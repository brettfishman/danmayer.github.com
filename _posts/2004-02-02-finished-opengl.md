I just finished my first opengl progam. I know this one isn't 3d but it could be. I just had a hard time moving back to c++ at first since i am so used to java and remembering all the wierd ways to pass things in c++ sucked. Anyways simple but wonderfull since i am done with my first working and well documentated opengl program. I think i have a good understanding of how to work with opengl now as well. Anyways it is a fractal look and enjoy. i know it is simple.    {% unless page.image %}
