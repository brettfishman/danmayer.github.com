{% include JB/setup %}

I am starting a series of self-reference materials on staples of web application delivery. A place to collect and document my learnings and understanding of various technologies I often reach for when designing systems. The first in this series will be about Content Delivery Networks. These reference pages will be updated over time and evolve as my usage or focuses change.
