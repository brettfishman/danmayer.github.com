Today I am collecting all of the source and all of the data from News Shaker. I am preparing to move everything to a new machine that is on a live connection that everyone from the outside can get to. I will then continue to add the rest of the features mentioned below. The last week has been used to add these features, while making little to no process on improving the results of the learning. I am going to talk with a few people about how to improve the learning before working with that part of the project to much more. Overall most of the code seems quite stable enough but alot needs to be done on the user interface to make it useable by normal people that aren't accustom to odd design and testing set ups. It must be cleaned up before it could ever really be used.
