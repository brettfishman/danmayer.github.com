{% include JB/setup %}

I am starting a series of self-reference materials on staples of web application delivery. A place to collect and document my learnings and understanding of various technologies I often reach for when designing systems. The first in this series was about [Ruby and Redis](/ruby/2022/03/26/ruby-redis) While this one will focus in on Content Delivery Networks. These reference pages will be updated over time and evolve as my usage or focus changes.
