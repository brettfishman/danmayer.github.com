This is a collection of various tips and things I use or have done in OpenGL. This is actually up on the web more as a refrence to myself than anything else. This is a collection of good links, programs, tutorials, and source code. That I have found usefull, created, or thought would be usefull to others. So enjoy any and all of my OpenGL info.    <b>Projects:</b>    3D shooter I wrote, it could obviously be improved alot but it is a good easy start.<br />[{% unless page.image %}

This was written in Visual Studio.net   [Get it](http://www.deadawakemovie.com/ml/files/Mayer_GL.zip)<br />I also made a fractal program into a openGL winamp plug in.  If your interested in doing conversions to a winamp plug in yourself, you can download the source and the DLL for winamp and mess around with this.<br />[Get the winamp code](http://www.deadawakemovie.com/ml/files/winamp.zip)        <b>Links:</b>    [A group of scanned 3D object models, and how to read and write them.](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/)    [ NEHE the best place to go for open GL resources.](http://nehe.gamedev.net/)
