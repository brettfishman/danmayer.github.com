I am on paternity leave, actually my second of 2 staggered Paternity leaves. I am about 1 week into my second leave, hanging out with little Theo. I have some time off to bond with my kid, but more importantly my wife has some time to go back to work and stay focused knowing, I've got this.

# Men's Paternity Promotes Gender Equity

My wife started sharing a bunch of information about paternity leave when we started discussing having a child. The choices men make to be more involved with the kid can help women who choose to work to avoid some of the associated career setbacks that often come with becoming a mother. There is some interesting research going on here, it seems to impact both work and home life. Increasing men's participation in chores and playing with children. I suspect that has something to do with the empathy gained, spending time at home alone with the kiddo.

Gotta make that dollar...

It helps you bond with your baby, and it has been show to increase the interest and time a father spends with his kids through out life. Ever here of of men jealous of the relationship between kids and their mothers. It is easy to see why kids could be closer to their moms, but taking paternity leave helps you to develop your own bond.

# Paternity Leave Stigma

> 96 percent of men are back at work after two weeks, while 13 percent do not take a single day off.  
> --[Boston College Research](http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/parenting/ct-stigma-of-paternity-leave-20170320-story.html)

While there still is some stigma and even well intentioned folks unintentionally may throw a few jokes your way. It is getting better, and the best way to help keep the progress going is normalize dad's taking of as much time as mom's do.

### I say, "Be the change, you want to see."

I can tell you people are extremely nice to me, when I am out as a dad 'alone' with out baby. Random folks hold doors, elevators, make nice comments, etc. I am not even kidding that earlier today an old woman pulled her car over to the side of the road and shouted out the open window, "It is so nice to see dad's taking their kids for a walk too." So while it is shifting this way, it is still rare enough to see a man caring for a baby that folks are surprised to see it.

So if you can again, take some time, Share the "burden." Enjoy some time with your kid, while they like you.

# Dude, Check Your Privilege!

Yep, I hear that.

Taking maternity or paternity leave in the US at all means you are pretty privileged. Only [12% of Americans have access to paid parental leave](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-maternity-leave-in-the-us/) and [the US is one of only three countries left in the world that do not guarantee paid maternity leave](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-maternity-leave-in-the-us/).

As with most of my posts and life, I understand my ability to take leave, work from home, and live with reduce income from my wife and I taking leave is lucky. As is the flexibility of my career / current job to support staggered paternity leave (split between baby's birth and Mom returning to work). As are many other things, the key point is if Paternity leave is available and viable to you as a mother or father, take it.

Also, it is fine if a Mom chooses not go back to work, a father taking paternity leave is still a good thing that lets you bond with your child and promotes all people's choices.
