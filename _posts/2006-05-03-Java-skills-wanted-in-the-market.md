I also have notice a big rise in the demand for C#/ASP programmers as well. So if your starting to hunt for a new Java developer position here is a list of things you might want to study up on a bit before going out on the job hunt:

      [Java RMI](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/rmi/javarmiproperties.html)[Java Swing Basics / tutorials](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/TOC.html)[EJB basics / tutorials](http://java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/EJBIntro/EJBIntro.html)[Some basic internationalization](http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Intl/IntlIntro/)[Java Date formatting](http://home.tiscali.nl/~bmc88/java/sbook/016.html) or more [Date timezones](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/SimpleTimeZone.html)[Java Applet security](http://www.securingjava.com/chapter-two/)[Compressing serialized objects or other output files in Java](http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/compression/)<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/kenb/com3337/rmi_tut.html>more about Java RMI[Threading issues of Array List](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html)[I know we all extend classes and work with interfaces, but they always ask questions about it at interviews](http://www.javacoffeebreak.com/java104/java104.html)There are also many [testing](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/White_Box_Testing.html) positions [available](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/software-eng/testing-faq/section-13.html) which want experience with [JUnit](http://supportweb.cs.bham.ac.uk/documentation/tutorials/docsystem/build/tutorials/junit/junit.html).
