I just learned that the final project in my computer graphics course is to make a simple 3d Doom like game. I am excited. Depending on the models and if we can make them or we are just using stock models I will try to put a bunch of my friends in the game so that I can kill them and they can all kill each other. Yeaaaa violence. Either way it is going to be my first few steps in the direction of 3D graphics which is really cool and exciting.
