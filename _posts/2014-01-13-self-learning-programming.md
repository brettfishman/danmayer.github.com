I think everyone in today's world should be learning a little about how to code. If you use a computer at some point you will want to better understand how it works, or you will want to be able to create something on it as opposed to using it only for consumption. Even learning some of the fundamentals of programming will help you understand how the applications you use to socialize or work function. The basics of creating a webpage, applying styles, and adding interactivity/data storage will come in handy far more often than you can imagine even if you never become a "developer".

Since the early days of the internet, you could basically find everything you needed to learn about programming online. This is especially true today given the explosion of online education that has happened in the last few years not just for programming, but for learning nearly anything one would want to study. I have been really interested in online and self learning education in general. As various people have asked about programming or wanting help making basic web pages, I have been specifically looking at developer education online. It is amazing how quickly the space is growing and how great the resources have become. Both for those who is interested in learning just a bit to make their own web pages, and for for those that want to learn it all and make a career out of software development. As education approaches the career level there are offline components as well, but even those programming bootcamps are a new and interesting education model..

__Note: Since I program primarily in Ruby, the resources are slightly skewed towards Ruby. Many of the resources, offer multiple languages and there are additional programs focused on other languages that might interest you.__

### Self Guided Free - Where To Start

Before going to a school or even an online class that has a schedule and assignments, I recommend starting with self learning at your own pace. Spend some time on nights and weekends and learn some of the basics and see what parts of programming might interest you.

I really recommend everyone starts by learning the basics of web programming. The beginner friendly courses at [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) is where I recommend everyone starts:

1. [HTML & CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)
2. [Javascript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)
3. Finally a "backend" language like [Ruby](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) or [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python)

After that, learning more and getting a deeper understand of a programming language of computer science basics in general makes sense.

### No Silver Bullet

I think all of this is really promising and interesting, but the industry is young. Mistakes will be made - some will be poorly trained, and some will be flat out ripped off while seeking knowledge. Make sure to research your choices, and just like college you really will get out of it what you put into it. As [LeVar Burton says on Reading Rainbow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_Rainbow), "But you don't have to take my word for it."
