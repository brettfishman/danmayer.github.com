Well today was a big relief... Since my server at work died twice on friday, I have been nervous all weekend that i might have lost all my work. today we recovered the server and i made sure to make backups of all of my files. So now even if the server dies (since we really dont know what the problem was) i wont loose any work. My project at work it moving along nicely. Their are about 900 sites in the database currently and we should be categorizing on the fly by the end of this week. Which will be a huge step. If all goes well i might have a highly successfully project right away. If not with some refinement over a few weeks we should be able to make it fairly successful.
