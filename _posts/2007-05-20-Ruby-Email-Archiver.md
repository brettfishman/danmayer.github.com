Checking and receiving email via ruby.    If you need to get emails and check emails via a ruby script this should get you started in the right direction. I needed to copy down about six thousand emails from my pop server, so I wrote up this little script.  Ruby makes email simple, you just need to know where to look and unfortunately most searches result in finding a 3rd party library that costs a pretty penny for email actions in ruby. What you really need is the [Net::POP3](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/net/pop/rdoc/classes/Net/POP3.html ) or the [Net::IMAP](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/net/imap/rdoc/classes/Net/IMAP.html). After going through the quick documentation and seeing some of the available code examples, writing the code is straightforward. This is just a very simple example, with hardly any error checking.
