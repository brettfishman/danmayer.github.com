Some of my favorite links from December. If you have any good links I missed pass them my way.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What you learn over 5 years is that every dependency, every line of code, every test, every feature is a DEBT or outage, waiting to happen.</p>&mdash; David Copeland (@davetron5000) <a href="https://twitter.com/davetron5000/status/934803721917222913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2017</a></blockquote>

> continuing my trend of having something from [@davetron5000](https://twitter.com/davetron5000) each month, and this month I have two ;)

### Software Development

* [one-click PDF microservice](https://elements.heroku.com/buttons/kimmobrunfeldt/url-to-pdf-api)
* [on Kafka and Redis streams](https://medium.com/@timothy_downs/introduction-to-redis-streams-133f1c375cd3)
* [distributed system with one process representing every user / shared resource in Elixir](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/elixir-distributed-system#.WkVr2AWFpx4.twitter), great talk [@myobie](https://twitter.com/myobie)
* [Understand why Serverless matters](https://what-problem-does-it-solve.com/serverless/index.html) another great write up by [@davetron5000](https://twitter.com/davetron5000)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK, updated my pre and post production testing diagram based on feedback I got. Still something I missed out? <a href="https://t.co/c3Q2wUSQdI">pic.twitter.com/c3Q2wUSQdI</a></p>&mdash; Cindy Sridharan (@copyconstruct) <a href="https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/946179034982989824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2017</a></blockquote>

### Ruby

* [GraphQL Performance in Rails](https://blog.codeship.com/graphql-and-performance-in-rails/)
* [Memory and Performance improvements for Pluck](https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2015/03/05/optimizing-rails-for-memory-usage-part-3-pluck-and-database-laziness)
   * If you have to iterate through huge collections and don't need the full object this is a huge win  
* [Malloc Can Double Multi-threaded Ruby Program Memory Usage](https://www.speedshop.co/2017/12/04/malloc-doubles-ruby-memory.html)
   * Sidekiq users can reduce memory use by 1.5-4x with a few config/environment changes  

### DevOps

* [Rapid Release at Massive Scale deployment at Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/posts/270314900139291/rapid-release-at-massive-scale)

### Tech Management

* [What does a CTO do?](https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev/status/900162683688935424)
* [On Timely Code Reviews](https://medium.com/@9len/on-code-review-16ea85f7c585)

### Random

* [10 years in and nobody has a use case for blockchains](https://hackernoon.com/ten-years-in-nobody-has-come-up-with-a-use-case-for-blockchain-ee98c180100)
   * yes this is a bit of a clickbait title, but many points still hold true. The claims of distributed aren't holding up to well with real world usage of blockchains.
