alright here is a post to my neglected blog. It always falls behind... Anyways i have been doing a ton of programming, but sadly none of it is very interesting or new right now. Alot of the stuff I am doing I have done before, but I am trying to build up a system which I can use to explore some new ideas and I need a nice simple toolset built up before doing anything else all the interesting. So it might be awhile, before I have any really interesting things to post on here, but i will try and we will see when I get a chance to get back to my AI interests.
