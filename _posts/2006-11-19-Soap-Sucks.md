I have said it for a long time now that XML and SOAP are bloated and most of the time the wrong way to do anything. Well it seems lead api developers are agreeing with me, it might have been the decade of XML but I hope to slowly see it fade to a hardly used only when needed standard, instead of the if it doesn't use XML it obviously isn't designed well.    Soap i wasted so much time and clock cycle for projects that you never did well and were always replaced.    [let me say now I'd never choose to use SOAP and WSDL again. I was wrong](http://www.somebits.com/weblog/tech/bad/whySoapSucks.html)
