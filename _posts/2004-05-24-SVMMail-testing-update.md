I have now gone through about 800 emails with my SVM / SMO mail filter. I am still getting about 97.5% accuracy. I have blocked over 700 spams from my mail account. I am taking off (to europe) and I am sure my mail will fill up with about 600 emails while I am gone so I will have a much larger test results when I return. Good luck to anyone else out there working with or thinking about SVMs / SMOs for spam filters. It looks like it is a winning combination. I hope my various code and articles can help you on your way.    peace,Dan Mayer
