Using my Text2SVM after learning how to increase java memory size so that i could do a large test was very successful. I used about 2,700 documents and then put them into SVMlight. I used 90% training data and 10% testing data leaving around 270 tests. I achieved 95% accuracy in training SVM to recognize one text category from another. I am highly excited! Tomorrow i will be testing with several of my smaller categories today i tested with my largest category. If these trends contrinue.... eeehhhh. I was really only hoping to achieve over 80% correct. So lets hope this is the start of something truely wonderful. I know that the results continuing this high are very unlikely, but i am still really excited about the first good results. I am pumped about doing more testing tomorrow!!
