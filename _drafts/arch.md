# Notes On Scaling Architecture Conversationally

A post on [Scaling Architecture Conversationally](https://martinfowler.com/articles/scaling-architecture-conversationally.html), is an excellent read on how to influence architecture as a community across a company opposed to more top down approaches. A set of tools, processes, and guidelines to building an architecture that will be more adapable.

> cross-functional requirements also helps a decentralised set of teams ensure that they look beyond their immediate, local delivery, and meet the minimum requirements for playing coherently in the shared ecosystem.

Another trend in me seeing more across many scaling talks along the lines of constraints breed creativity... It also feels like the contrainsts let folks work both in a aligned way while also having autonomy.

> Architectural Principles: in a world of highly-autonomous-teams they become essential because they are the means by which an aligned delivery direction is achieved without the need for control.

Requirements and Principles are the constraints that let folks work autonomously while still building on the collective vision.

> for any architectural principle to be successful, teams which deliver against them need to feel a sense of ownership over it.

The reasons to push for community architecture, is that it will actually both be better and more adopted when everyone has ownership over it.
