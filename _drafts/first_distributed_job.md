I have worked with distributed teams for awhile. A surprising number of developers ask how they can get a job, not a developer job mind you a distributed job. Obviously, for some people working with a distributed team and being able to work from home or while traveling is a major perk. I do think that often these folks, if they haven't worked on a distributed team before only see the benefits not the challenges and issues that come along with it. In fact many are folks who are looking for their first time professional developer roles.

### Pros

* Working from home as a Parent: less folks post on this because of stigma, but I know a lot of folks that work from home as they get to see their kids more.
* Work while traveling: Some folks live for this [1](https://nomadlist.com/blog/bartering-skills), [2](https://www.toptal.com/freelance/the-traveling-engineers-survival-guide), etc...
* No commute: I could spend the same hours as most commuters and get in an extra hour a day.
* Increased focus time (seriously [open air offices](http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20170105-open-offices-are-damaging-our-memories) are [the worst](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_ladder/2016/05/open_plan_offices_add_distractions_and_hurt_productivity.html) and shown [to hurt productivity](http://mentalfloss.com/article/84222/open-offices-are-bad-productivity-study-finds))
* Flexible hours are amazing... Start early, work after dinner, long lunch, sunny warm day in winter, work outside, take a nap, or pause when not focusing well.
* Introverts: Um, yeah so those great long group conversations about sports / TV / movies... No for everyone
* and many more reasons

### Cons

* Lack of community / comradery 
* Slower and more complex communication
* Async communication can be harder than high bandwidth real time communication

### Mentorship

### Advice

When looking for your first distributed or work from home development job there are a number of things that can help. Look for ways to gain experience with the workflow before joining a team that is fully distributed. You want to do this as much for yourself to see if you enjoy the way distributed teams work. Often finding a company that is partially distributed with a [hub and spoke](https://wptavern.com/how-crowd-favorite-utilizes-multiple-offices-and-a-distributed-work-force) office model. 

* If you current company has any partially distributed teams, try to work with or transfer to that team.
* If you current company works with offsite contractors, try to work on the contractor project (manage, integration, be the in-company point person). 
* If you currently work with a team that is all at same location see about working from home some portion of the time.
* If you have no way to gain experience working with distributed folks through your current gig, look at gaining that experience through open source.
   * Find an active open source project with a small number of distributed members
   * Join the conversation, help with issue management, contribute documentation, code, and whatever else.
   * Try to help improve the distributed practices of that project
   * Work with the project to gain the experience of seeing how a group of folks ship something without being in person.
