The innovators while was released before the pandemic when many companies took another look at remote work, continues to highlight how the best teams and creativity cone from spontanoeus interactions... It calls out pixar, yahoo (using marisa may as a positive example), and the new apple HQ taht was being designed as examples of proof... all trying to recreate the experience sof xerox parc and other highly collaborative labs that helped create microsoft, apple, and the other giants of today... While the book does cover linux and the open source revolution and bringing global collaboritive, it moves on past how most of the collbaroation and the winning solutions of open source for OS, servers, and other solutions really present and beat all the in person collaborative environments like xerox parc. It seems to not acknowldge that we have actually build things to the point we can move beyond that and holds it up as the best way for high speed innovation, and misses the point of how opensource source has enabled and been profiteered by companies taht still try to recreate xerox parc to this day not understanding how the software that has created google, AWS, and OS X all was created despite folks trying to constantly force creators to be in high interupt driven in person "spontaneous environments".
