## bridge

software developer: I built your bridge it is a scale model that people can walk across
business: great, let's try it out... this is amazing people love this bridge. We told everyone about it. We are opening it to automobile next week
software developer: but it was build for a few people, that isn't a good idea
business: we have cars on the way now, fix it
dev: um holy crap add all extra wood and steel to random pieces that look week, widen the path, put up a fake diverted route path to try to have people go around it.
business: the bridge is kind of falling over, and it is on fire... at least 3 people have died
dev: oh no, put out the flames we can just temporarily flood the bridge and it will drain quickly, perhaps we should stop sending people to the bridge until we can build a better bigger one.
business: There will be bus traffic beginning tomorrow
