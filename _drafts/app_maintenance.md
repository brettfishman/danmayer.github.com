Things that increase app maintence...

* Tons of dependencies
* Fast moving language without strong backwards compatability garuntees (Ruby and Javascript less likely to stay stable than Clojure)
* Public Internet Facing, apps on the public internet require tighter security controls and will face nearly constant onslaughts of security probes.
* Your deployment setup, for example heroku requires moving from one stack to another every year or so.
