A good post on this but the other side is as a new engineer or Manger to a team, keep and list and write down things and watch for awhile before just trying to make tons of recommendations or ask why all the time... folks making recommendations without context often rehashes and revisits settled discussions over and over and wastes a lot of time without understanding the implications and hidden complexity of the suggestion. It can create endless churn by say returning to an old system that wasn't working before even completing the migration to the new system designed to address the issues.
