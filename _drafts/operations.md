While this is a great article and I agree either all the issues on MTTR... I still find it valuable in the sense of throwing out all the outliers and looking at just well understood incidents... I want to know the MTTR to resolve and immediately known incident that devs are trying to solve just with a rollback, revert, config change... in that sense perhaps the metric is fastest possible recovery time (FPRT)... It implies improvements needed to the deployment, feature flag releases, or encouraging safer change processes controls. Not helpful for unknowns which require investigations, the metric is how fast can we respond to a failed change and do we have the tools to reduce the impact... If your Fastest Possible Recovery Time from a buggy release is a 10m outage, it is worth discussing if that is an acceptable cost.
