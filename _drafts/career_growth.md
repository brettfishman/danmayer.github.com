# Career Growth

## Take Notes

See my post on Markdown standups

## Self Reflect

Review and reflect what you are learning and if you are making progress on the things you want. If you feel like you are headed a direction purpusefully or un-intentionally... Ignoring where your current work takes you means you are letting others drive your career or falling into paths unintentionally.

## early growth

network, learn what options are out there, open source (build and release something of your own, get a PR accepted to something you love/respect), speak, blog, build things and throw them away after sharing and having someone tell you how terrible it was and pointing out a better solution...

see if annyce has anything about how blogging and speaking accelerated her  career...

## Mentoring

> If you start dedicating even a couple hours a week to developing the team around you, it’s quite likely that will become your legacy long after your tech specs and pull requests are forgotten.

people often talk about how important it is for folks to feel like their work is appreciated... that is true, but what we don't talk about as often is how important it is to appreciate the work of the people and team around you... If you aren't inspired and learning from some of the amazing work from your teammates, you are missing out on some job satisfaction and career growth.

The ceo doesn't spent the majority of there time coaching and mentoring and if they do, be worried... having Sr devs that are good mentors is key and critical to growing a dev team, but if all you have is mentors you are likely missing experts, innovators, and those still keeping up and growing with the constantly expanding tech. 

## Look Out For Your Growth

No matter how great your company is, or your manager, or your peer group... A lot of systems are set up and built in to slow career and salary growth. Often times even folks with the best intentions are helping keep the status quo... I am not saying you need to always be job-hopping, but you do need to look out and pay attention to your career and know what you are worth and how folks are growing around you.

I honestly don't know why companies set things up this way as it is bad for both sides... Companies seem to not realize or undervalue institutional knowledge... Setting up roadblocks to growing internally at a company... while developers who get to focus on making the next career or salary band, miss out on all the learnings that come from working on and maintaining a system over a long period of time. A kind of growth that will help inform long-term thinking and push past some of the self-imposed paper-cuts that folks and teams often make when every problem disappears by moving on soon after. I will be very clear though, it is for companies to provide the right incentives, I am just saying devs that move around a lot also miss out in some ways they might not realize.

## Know How Your Org Works

This is a great post by [@copyconstruct](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct) called [Know How Your Org Works](https://copyconstruct.medium.com/know-how-your-org-works-or-how-to-become-a-more-effective-engineer-1a3287d1f58d). It is an excellent post that distills great advice on how to thrive even when you disagree with parts of your org, or consider parts to be a mess. Knowing how to get things done and not getting lost in the weeds or always trying to fix everything first... I couldn't have writen something as good on this topic if I tried... Know how things really work, especially if you are going to spend time trying to change improve them.
