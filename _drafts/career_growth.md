# Career Growth

## Take Notes

See my post on Markdown standups

## Self Reflect

Review and reflect what you are learning and if you are making progress on the things you want. If you feel like you are headed a direction purpusefully or un-intentionally... Ignoring where your current work takes you means you are letting others drive your career or falling into paths unintentionally.

## Mentoring

> If you start dedicating even a couple hours a week to developing the team around you, itâ€™s quite likely that will become your legacy long after your tech specs and pull requests are forgotten.

people often talk about how important it is for folks to feel like their work is appreciated... that is true, but what we don't talk about as often is how important it is to appreciate the work of the people and team around you... If you aren't inspired and learning from some of the amazing work from your teammates, you are missing out on some job satisfaction and career growth.
