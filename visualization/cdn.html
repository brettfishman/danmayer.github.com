    <h1>CDN (content delivery network)</h1>
    <p>
      A content delivery network, or content distribution network (CDN), is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users. CDNs came into existence in the late 1990s as a means for alleviating the performance bottlenecks of the Internet[1][2] as the Internet was starting to become a mission-critical medium for people and enterprises. Since then, CDNs have grown to serve a large portion of the Internet content today...

    <h2>Minimum of what you want your CDN to be doing for you</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>handling assets taking static file loads of dynamic servers</li>
      <li>caching: at least assets, but likely additional content</li>
      <li>compression: gzip and brotli</li>
    </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>The best defense for this is DNS fallback routing around the CDN... If you configure a failover routing policy. For example on AWS, Route53 would check the health of your Cloudfront distribution and if it's not healthy then the traffic would failover directly to your load balancer.</li>
